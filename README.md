# Locket_fw
Firmware for the Locket Project ([Russian description](https://ostranna.ru/gamedesign/locket), [English description](https://ostranna.ru/?lang=en))

Locket is the device for LARPs. It has stm32 microcontroller, 868 MHz radio, buttons, vibro, RGB led, beeper and accelerometer. It is placed in nice 3d-printed case. Locket may be used for rather complex gamedesign. It is powered by two AAA batteries. 

Locket has several hardware (and firmware) versions (we call them new lockets, old lockets and ancient lockets). Master branch is for old lockets, for new lockets use master v.5
Some branches are for [Atollic TrueStudio](https://atollic.com/truestudio/), others for Eclipse. See .project folder for this information.
Archived branches https://github.com/Kreyl/Locket_fw/tags

Most popular branch: 
* FeelEachOther - all lockets vibrate when feel other lockets near them;
* 7colors â€” activates magic path (special leds with radio, corresponding branch [here](https://github.com/Kreyl/chibi-armlet/tree/7Colors);
